# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project creates cards to store text messages.
->The cards are resizeable
->The cards are draggable
->you can connect two cards by double-clicking the source and target card.
->you can remove a card.
->The read more button is dynamically put so that it renders when a certain length is crossed in text file.
->The read more button creates a pop-up overlay on the card which enables the user to read all the contents.
